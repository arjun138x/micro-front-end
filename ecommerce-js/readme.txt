- we are just using the plane JavaScript to build Run-Time Integration (Client-Side Composition) 
- we need these packages
  - npm i  webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin 
- child repo should be hosted/run and add the host configuration in parent webpack.config.js
- to avoid this error `Uncaught Error: Shared module is not available for eager consumption: webpack/sharing/consume/default/faker/faker`
  - create a bootstrap.js file and import the file into index.js 
  - keep all the  code into bootstrap.js file
